# HealthyLife

HealthyLife is web application, which main purpose is to helps the users in curing its disease by recommending the list of herbs, fruits and vegetabils that the user need to consume in order to get rid ot disease.
I decided to build this web app, because I couldn't find any application which use only natural drugs to help people with diseases. So, the main purpose of this project is to give a chance to users to easily search for herbs, fruits and vegetabils that will be good for the health of the user depending on any health issue or disease that he/she is suffering from. User does not need to find it on google, and visit a lot of different web pages, our web app will be enough for everyone.

The main entities of this app is: 

- Administrator/Moderator – person who will entering diseases, herbs, fruits and vegetabils, blog news etc.
-User – someone who will search for content listed above. User can search and read for content without registration, but cannot rate drugs and give feedback, recommend other drugs etc.
-Disease – big database which will contain different types of diseases, in different fields of medicine. Every disease will have pictures, description, and list of best rated diseases by registered users.Users can rate some of displayed drugs, with icon for helpfull, or icon for not helpfull, or write their own opinion, recommend more drugs, share experience with other users..
 Drugs – already mentioned: fruits, herbs and vegetabils, which will be rated and displayed in a list for every disease. Every drug will have pictures, description, and feedback from users. Of course, individual rate will be displayed.
- Blog – administrator or moderator, by time to time will enter some funny facts about medicine, natural drugs and other staff from this field.

HealthyLife will have home page, section about application, categories in which drugs will be sorted, blog and contact page. Big search field will be displayed at the beginning of the home page, where users will enter disease.

Of course, for registered users there will be pages about profile.

This project will be developed in MEAN Stack tecnhologies(MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angular I, NodeJS). 
JSON Web Token will be used for authentication. Also, CloudFlare service will be used.
